                        <h2>Suttur Math</h2>
                        <p>The founding of the Math can be traced to a historical event linked with Sri Shivarathreeshwara Shivayogi Mahaswamigalu crusading for peace between two warring kingdoms. The hostility between Rachamalla IV of the Gangas of Talkad and Rajaraja of Cholas was about to break up into a large scale war. It was due to the timely intervention of Sri Shivarathreeshwara Swamigalu the hostility ended and the enemies became friends. Then it was on the request of Rajaraja, the Swamigalu graciously condescended to establish a Math on the banks of the river Kapila at Suttur near Mysore.</p>

            <h1>About</h1>

            <p>
            The Jagadguru Veerasimhaasana Peetha established in the 11th Century A.D. at Suttur by Adi Jagadguru Sri Shivarathreeshwara Shivayogi Mahaswamiji has a history dating back to 1000 years, according to the scriptures. Suttur is a village in Nanjangud taluk, Mysore district in Karnataka. It is about 28 km from Mysore city, in the south east direction.
            </p>


            <p>
            The Peetha with its high ideals has been making remarkable contribution in religious, social, educational and economic spheres in the state and across the country. It is striving for social development by responding to the community needs. It strongly believes that unless the problems of the socially backward communities and the poor are solved, there cannot be any social development. With this objective, it has taken up several development initiatives, while at the same time living up to its principle of `work is worship’ and is engaged in raising public awareness on issues of social concern.
            </p>

            <p>
            The establishment of the Samskritha Paathashala by the 22nd Peethadheeshwara (Pontiff) Sri Shivarathreeshwara Mahaswamiji who was popularly known as the Mantra Maharshi might be called a landmark in the history of the Sree Math. When the 23rd Peethadheeshwara (Pontiff) Jagadguru Dr. Sri Shivaratri Rajendra Mahaswamiji came to Mysore in 1926 to pursue higher education, he observed that many rural students were in need of food and shelter. He gave them shelter at his own place and this marked the beginning of offering education to poor students. As far back as 1942, he established a hostel and offered free food and hostel facilities for poor rural students. This marked Sree Math’s first step in the field of development of the society.

            <p><strong>Suttur, 22 August 2016:</strong> “Religious tolerance is ingrained in the fundamental principles of Indian heritage. It is said in Ramayana that our motherland is greater than heaven. This reveals the expansiveness of the idea of nationality held in ancient times. We can perceive from history that there was no relation between ipolitical diplomacy and religion in olden days,” opined Prof. Padmashekar, Vice-Chancellor of the Karantaka Sanskrit University, Bengaluru.</p>
